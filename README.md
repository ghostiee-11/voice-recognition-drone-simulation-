# 🛸 Voice-Controlled Drone Simulation

## 📝 Description
This project simulates drone movements controlled through live voice commands using speech recognition.  
It demonstrates real-time interaction between a user and a simulated drone, ideal for prototyping voice-driven control systems without the need for any pre-recorded dataset.
